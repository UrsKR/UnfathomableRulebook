title: BSG Unified Rulebook
---

## Introduction

This rulebook is intended for players who are familiar with the BSG board game already, but need to refer to the picky details of rules and/or clarifications that FFG has put out in their FAQs. The hope is that it's an unambiguous single source for looking up the rules, rather than digging through and comparing 7 different sources (there's the base game, base game additional rules, each of the 3 expansions, and both official and unofficial FAQs). 

It includes all the new rules and mechanics for all 3 expansions in one place, and except for the setup instructions it treats each part of each expansion as independent. If you want to change things around, or include parts from other expansions without the rest of the expansion, just make those changes during setup and the rest of the rulebook should still make sense. Whenever possible, this guide treats the base game and expansions as one big game with many different modules and variations. It also tries to avoid expansion-specific rules whenever possible. So, for example, there is just 1 procedure for building the Loyalty deck that accounts for all the expansions. 


## Game setup

### Game board
Setting up the game board is fairly straightforward. The resource dials should be at their defaults, skill cards go next to their respective spaces on the bottom, vipers and raptors go in the reserves, and the fleet marker goes on the jump track. All other components and decks should go somewhere near the board. The Skill card discard piles should be face-up next to *each* Skill draw pile. 


When an expansion includes a "fancy" version of an existing component, such as the plastic basestars and Centurions, they are used *instead of* those components, not *along with*. The number of components is important, because they are not treated as unlimited resources. 

If you have the Daybreak expansion, even if you're not playing with it, it can be useful to use Miracle tokens to track who has and has not used their once-per-game ability. 

The starting layout of ships is:

- One basestar and 3 raiders in front of Galactica (left space area)
- Two vipers below Galactica (one in each space area with the launch tube icon)
- Two civilian ships behind Galactica (right space area). 

### Add expansions

There are 3 expansions to Battlestar Galactica, each one adding new components, options, and endings. Only one ending can be chosen per game, but the other options are all compatible with one another. In order to use a component from an expansion, there is a base set of components that must be included first. For example, to play the Cylon Fleet option, the "base" Exodus expansion must be included. 

#### Pegasus

Pegasus includes 3 components: the base Pegasus expansion, Cylon Leaders, and the New Caprica ending. 

For the base expansion, add these items in with the base game:

- The new character sheets and tokens
- The Battlestar Pegasus game board and Pegasus damage tokens
- The Cylon Overlay, covering the regular Cylon Locations
- New Skill Cards (including "Reckless" Treachery cards)
    - This expansion includes new "Investigative Committee" cards, which *don't* show the Destiny deck's contribution. The original "Investigative Committee" cards should be removed from the game when including these new ones. 
- New Crisis, Destination, Quorum, Super Crisis Cards, and Loyalty cards
- The "Scar" token, which should go with the Cylon raiders

To play with Cylon Leaders, also add the Cylon Leader sheets and tokens. The Cylon leader will also need the "Infiltrator" card and Agenda cards. 

To play with the New Caprica ending, instead of using the "Kobol" objective, use the "New Caprica" objective and follow the instructions on it at the indicated distances. The alternate President and Admiral title cards add new information that will be used in the New Caprica phase, so they should be used instead of the regular title cards. Have the New Caprica game board, New Caprica Crisis deck, and Occupation Force tokens ready for when the New Caprica phase begins, but it doesn't need to be set up until then. 

#### Exodus

Exodus includes 4 components: the base Exodus expansion, Conflicted Loyalties, Cylon Fleet, and the Ionian Nebula ending.

For the base expansion, add these items in:

- New character sheets and tokens
- New Crisis, Quorum, Super Crisis, Skill, and Destination cards. Only include the "CAG Chooses" Crisis and Super Crisis cards if also playing with Cylon Fleet. 
- One additional nuke token next to the board. The Admiral still only receives 2 to start, but now humans may earn more through game effects. 

Conflicted Loyalties consists of two new types of "not a Cylon" Loyalty card: Personal Goal cards, and Final Five cards. One or both sets can be added while building the Loyalty deck.  

For the Cylon Fleet:

- Remove all Cylon attack cards from the Crisis and Super Crisis decks. Also remove the "Mining Asteroid" Destination, if present (since it uses the "Scar" Cylon attack card). 
- Add all "CAG Chooses" Crisis and Super Crisis cards to their respective decks.
-  Place the Cylon Fleet board to the left of the main board, with the Cylon Pursuit marker on the "Start" space.
-  Remove 2 regular vipers from the game, and place the 4 Mark VII vipers in the "Damaged Vipers" box. 
-  Add the 4 additional Cylon raiders to the stock of Cylon raiders, for a total of 20. 
-  Add the CAG title card with the other title cards for distribution later.
-  Replace the Admiral title card with the Alternate version from Exodus. It changes how nukes work. (When playing with New Caprica as well, use the nuke rules on the Exodus version, but the Admiral still has access to the game ending jump option on the New Caprica card.)

For the Ionian Nebula:

- Replace the regular basestar damage tokens with the larger, rectangular damage tokens. Remove the old damage tokens from the game.
- Place the trauma tokens facedown and randomize them. 
- Shuffle and set aside the Crossroads Cards. 
- Replace the Kobol objective with the Ionian Nebula. 
- Shuffle the Ally cards and put the Ally tokens next to the board. 

There are more setup instructions for Ionian Nebula after players choose their characters. 

#### Daybreak

Daybreak includes 2 components: the base expansion and the Search for Home ending. 

To set up the base expansion, 

- Place the Colonial One overlay over Colonial One, and the Cylon Locations overlay over the Cylon Locations. This Cylon Locations overlay is the one with "Hub Destroyed" on the back. Make sure that "Colonial One Destroyed" and "Hub Destroyed" are face down. 
- Place one assault raptor in the Reserves, and the rest next to the game board. 
- Shuffle the Mutiny deck and place it next to the board.
- Add the new character sheets and tokens.
- Add in the new Skill cards, including the "Mutiny" Treachery cards, which are a new type. Note that the Daybreak and Pegasus Treachery cards do *not* mix. Use only Daybreak's Treachery cards when combining expansions. 
- Give each player 1 miracle token. 

To set up the Search for Home, use the "Earth" Objective card instead of any other Objective card. Place the Demetrius board to the left of the main game board and leave room for the Rebel Basestar board, which may be set up later as the result of a Mission. The Mission deck is shuffled and placed near Demetrius. 

### Choosing characters

Determine a first player randomly. They will choose their character first and take the first turn. Both character choice and gameplay will proceed clockwise from there. 

- Only 1 player can choose to play as a Cylon Leader, and only if there are 4 or more players. 
- Players may not choose "alternate" versions of characters that have already been chosen. Note that "Boomer" and "Athena" are *not* alternates of each other, they are separate characters that may both be chosen in the same game. 
- When choosing political, military, or pilot characters, players must choose from the category that is most plentiful. 
    - For example, if there are 4 military, 3 political, and 3 pilots, more politicians and pilots cannot be chosen until a military leader is chosen. 
    - An "alternate" version of a character must still be considered even if it can no longer be chosen. 
    - Support characters can be chosen at any time. 

Once all characters are chosen, distribute titles to the highest in the orders of succession. 

### Loyalty Deck

#### Loyalties and executions

Both Exodus and Pegasus expansions include executions, but they work in different ways. The changes to executions also affect the Loyalty deck. See the "House Rules" section at the end for more discussion on this. If you are including the Exodus expansion, make sure to follow the rules for an "_extra-card style_" deck wherever it is mentioned. (The _extra-card_ style Loyalty deck has 1 extra Loyalty card after the Sleeper Agent phase. Human players have a chance at coming back as Cylons, but there will always be a Loyalty card left over which could mean that a Cylon never appears.)

#### Building the Loyalty deck

- Build two decks of cards: the "You Are a Cylon" and the "Not a Cylon" decks. 
    - If using the "Final Five" or "Personal Goal" cards, or both, they go in the "Not a Cylon" deck. The "Personal Goal" cards require an "extra card style" Loyalty deck.
    - Some "You Are A Cylon" cards refer to Treachery skill cards. Remove them if you aren't playing with any Treachery cards.
    - Some "Personal Goal" cards cause executions. Technically, there are not supposed to be executions unless either Exodus or Pegasus are being played. 
- Assemble the Loyalty deck out of these two as follows, based on the total number of players and whether one of them is a Cylon Leader:

 | Cylon Leader? | Players |  Cylon cards | Not a Cylon cards | 
 | ------------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
 |      No       |    3    |      1       |         5         | 
 |      No       |    4    |      1       |         6         | 
 |      No       |    5    |      2       |         8         | 
 |      No       |    6    |      2       |         9         | 
 |     Yes       |    4    |      1       |         5         | 
 |     Yes       |    5    |      1       |         7         | 
 |     Yes       |    6    |      2       |         8         | 
 |     Yes       |    7    |      2       |        10         | 

- Add one more "Not a Cylon" card for each of these that are true:
    - Sharon "Boomer" Valerii was chosen by a player
    - Gaius Baltar (the political leader version with "Coward") was chosen by a player
    - The Exodus expansion has been included with its "extra card style" Loyalty deck
- If playing with Daybreak:
     - With a Cylon Leader *and* 5 or 7 total players: add The Mutineer card to the Loyalty deck. 
     - With *no* Cylon Leader, *and* 4 or 6 total players: add The Mutineer card *and* another "Not a Cylon" card to the Loyalty deck. 
- If playing with 4 or 6 players, without Daybreak, and no Cylon Leaders, do one of these:
     - Take the "You Are a Sympathizer" card, but don't add it to the Loyalty deck yet. Only add it after the first round of Loyalty cards go out.
     - Get the "You Are a Sympathetic Cylon" card and the "Sympathetic Agenda" cards (they have Caprica Six on the back), but don't add anything to the Loyalty Deck yet. Only add it after the first round of Loyalty cards go out. 
     - Play with the rules from the "No Sympathizer" variant. See the "House Rules" section at the end of this rulebook for more information.
- Keep the "Not a Cylon" deck separate but secret from the Loyalty deck. It might be used later to add more cards to the Loyalty deck. The "Cylon" deck should be kept secret as well, but it will not be used the rest of the game.


The Loyalty deck should now finally be complete. Shuffle it and distribute 1 card to every (non-Cylon Leader) player unless otherwise specified (Gaius Baltar and Boomer). After the first round is dealt, add the Sympathizer card if it was indicated. 

The Cylon Leader receives either 2 Motive cards, or 1 Agenda card from the appropriate deck. (For a 4 or 6 player game use the Sympathetic deck, which has Caprica Six on the back. For a 5 or 7 player game use the Hostile deck, which has a Centurion on the back.)

### First hand of cards

Every player *except* the first player draws 3 cards to start the game. (As always, these must come from within their skill set.) The first player will get to draw their normal hand of cards in the first turn. A Cylon Leader draws 2 cards instead of 3 unless they begin the game as an Infiltrator.

### Ionian Nebula additional setup

To finish setting up for a game with the Ionian Nebula ending:

- Place 1 Trauma token in the Brig, and 1 in Sickbay. Do not look at or reveal either one. 
- Each player draws 3 trauma tokens, keeping them hidden. If a player draws "Disaster", the one that looks like a splatter of blood, they should reveal it to everyone, replace it with a new token, then shuffle "Disaster" back into the pool. 
- Draw and place Ally cards and their respective tokens until 3 are placed on the board. If an Ally is a duplicate of an existing player, remove it from the game and re-draw. Place a Trauma token from the pool face down on each of the 3 Ally cards. 


## Playing The Game

### Winning/Losing

The humans win by ending the game without losing. Humans can lose by:

- Running out of a resource (0 or less) at the *end* of a player's turn or at the end of the game. Humans can still survive if a resource reaches 0 by replenishing that resource before the turn ends. 
- Centurion Invasion: A centurion reaching the "Humans Lose" space on the Boarding Party track
- Galactica Destroyed: Galactica is destroyed when 6 or more locations are damaged at once. 
- No more characters: A human is executed, but there are no more characters to be chosen. 

### Component limitations

Obviously there are not an infinite number of ship tokens and other items in the game, so they are allowed to run out. 

In the event of component limitations for ships, the current player decides the order of placement, and if necessary, which ones are placed and which are not placed. If a heavy raider cannot become a Centurion due to component limitations, the heavy raider remains on the board. 

When using the Cylon Fleet board and a game effect instructs a player to place Cylon ships on the main game board, draw from the normal pile as usual. However, if the normal pile has run out but the Cylon Fleet board has some of the appropriate ship, then ships should be drawn from the *lowest numbered* Cylon space area possible. This does not affect the other ships in that space area. The pursuit track is not advanced. If both the normal pile and the Cylon Fleet board are out of a ship, then the normal component limitation rules apply. 

When activating the Hanger Deck, if there are no vipers in the reserves players may move an unmanned viper in a space area to the reserves and then launch using it. 

When a deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck. 

### Game turn

A human player's game turn consists of the following steps:

1. If there is a Trauma token in the player's current location, they must draw it and place 1 Trauma token from the pool on that location to replace it.
- Receive Skills: 
    - Human players receive cards according to their character sheet. 
- Movement: 
    - Player may move their character to a new location. In order to move to another ship, the player must first discard 1 skill card from their hand. If they have no cards to discard, they cannot move between ships.
        - The discard is completely resolved before the character moves. This is important for cards like "Sabotoge" which can trigger when a card is discarded. (For "Sabotage", this means that if the player's _starting_ location is damaged, they must move to Sickbay instead of their desired location. If their _destination_ location is damaged, the character is not there when it is damaged so they may still move there.)
        - If, after discarding, the move is no longer legal, the player does not move and their Movement step is over. 
    - Players may, instead of moving their character, use a "Movement: " action that is available to them. 
        - Note that effects like "may not use actions on Piloting Cards" or "discard 1 Skill card to use a Skill card action" also apply to Movement actions. 
    - A player piloting a viper may move their ship to an adjacent space area, or may discard a skill card to move to a location on any ship and return their viper to the Reserves. Neither of these moves is a viper activation.
    - Players may not choose to move to "hazardous" locations, they can only be sent there by a game effect that specifies that exact location.
    - Human players are not allowed to move to Cylon locations (and vice versa). 
- At the end of the Movement step, if in a location with 1 or more Ally tokens, choose 1 ally to encounter and resolve it. 
    - This is simultaneous with Ellen Tigh's "Politically Adroit" since both occur "at the end of your Movement step". As always, the current player (Ellen Tigh) may choose which order they are resolved in. If encountering an Ally causes a move, she may use "Adroit" in her new location if she hasn't already.
- Action:
    - Player may choose 1 action to perform ("Do Nothing" is always an available action as well). Unless otherwise noted, these are always printed on something with the word "Action:" in front of it. Actions can come from
        - Their current location
        - A Skill Card
        - An ability on a character sheet
        - A Title card
        - A Quorum card
        - A Loyalty Card
        - While piloting a viper, the player may Activate the ship that they are piloting as an action.
- Crisis: Unless otherwise indicated, the current player draws and resolves a Crisis card. 
- Activate Cylon Ships as directed by the bottom left corner of Crisis card(s) played during this turn
- Prepare for Jump for Crisis card(s) played during this turn
- End turn. Discard Crisis cards. *All players* must discard Skill Cards down to the 10 card limit if necessary. If any resource is at 0 or lower, humans lose.

There is a subtle difference between a "move" and a "Movement:" action. A "move" is the act of moving a character token, whether that is within a ship, across ships (discarding 1 Skill card), piloting a viper to a new space area, or landing a viper (discarding 1 Skill card). When a card allows a player to move, or says that a player cannot move, these are what it is referring to. In contrast, a "Movement:" action is an action that players may take *only during the Movement step of their turn* instead of moving. If an effect grants a "move", like Executive Order, this does not allow the player to use a Movement action instead. Similarly, although the Brig forbids *moving*, players may still use Movement actions during their Movement step while in the Brig. 

Normally, when a player initiates an action that requires a die roll, that player performs the roll. This is important for characters with the ability to affect *their* die rolls, like Kat. Make sure to pay attention to whether the ability specifes "on your turn" in order to use it. Also note that in the rulebook, the FTL location specifies that the current player rolls to see if population is lost, making it an exception to this rule. 

Die rolls can be changed by game effects, but the result cannot be made greater than 8 or less than 1. 

Players must be given a reasonable opportunity to use abilities. For example, you may not rush to put cards into a Skill check to prevent players from using a card that can only be played before cards are added. 

Multiple Crisis cards can be resolved in the same turn in certain situations, like the "State of Emergency" card, which allows each player to perform an Action, including Cylon players. If this occurs, any Crisis card played is resolved as normal, but the "Activate Cylon Ships" and "Prepare for Jump" icons for each Crisis are not resolved until the end of the turn during the normal "Activate Cylon Ships" and "Prepare for Jump" steps listed above. Resolve each Crisis card in the order that they were played. 


### Timing

In general, when a timing conflict occurs or a choice needs to be made about what order things happen in, the choice is up to the current player. For example, if two players want to play cards before a Skill Check, the current player chooses which one happens first (this may force the other player to retract their card). The current player also chooses which components to place and which to skip if there is a shortage, and which space areas to activate Cylon ships in first. 

When "all players" are instructed to do something, unless otherwise specified the current player goes first, moving in clockwise order. 


### Skill Cards

Skill Cards usually have either an Action or some other ability printed on them. A card with "Action: " can be played as an Action, while other cards will indicate when they can be played and what effect they will have. 

Some cards have "Movement" actions, which can be used by players *only* during the Movement step of *their* turn instead of moving their character. (Note that this does *not* include being the target of an Executive Order, because it is not your turn, and the Executive Order only grants a *move*, not a *Movement*.) If a game effect restricts or modifies a type of action, it also applies to Movement actions of that type. 

A "Reckless" Skill Card has "Reckless" printed at the top of the text area. They always have an effect that is playable just before a skill check. Only one Reckless ability may be played per Skill Check, and they enable Reckless Skill Check abilities in the Skill Check. In Daybreak, they could cause extra Treachery cards to be activated (since there are no Reckless Skill Check Abilities.)

When the "Skill Check Ability" icon appears next to the strength of a Skill card, the text of the card is triggered only when it is revealed as a part of a Skill Check. A "Reckless Skill Check" ability is only triggered when the Skill Check was made Reckless. Additional copies of the same card are not resolved. 

"Restore Order" cannot be played on a Skill check after it has been made Reckless, and Reckless cards cannot be played on a Skill check after it has had "Restore Order" applied to it. 

Cylon players are not allowed to use the text abilities on Skill Cards, with the exception of Treachery cards. Humans are the exact opposite: they may use the text abilities on all Skill Cards *except* Treachery cards. Since Skill Check Abilities are played anonymously, both human and Cylon players can contribute them to Skill Checks regardless of type. Unless otherwise specified, Treachery cards always count as negative. 

#### Types
- Politics: This skill represents a character’s ability to control morale and help the fleet overcome crises. This is the most common skill type required by Crisis Cards. Some politics cards also provide the ability to allow a player draw Skill Cards from outside his skill set.- Leadership: This skill represents a character’s ability to take charge of situations and command other individuals. This is the second-most common skill type required by Crisis Cards. Some leadership cards allow players to move other characters and grant them a bonus action.- Tactics: This skill type represents a character’s ability to plan missions as well as to physically overcome obstacles. Tactics cards allow players to gain bonuses to die rolls as well as scout the galaxy for new destinations.- Piloting: This skill represents a character’s ability to fly vipers. Piloting cards allow players to reroll enemy attack rolls as well as gain additional attacks.- Engineering: This skill represents a character’s strength in the mechanical and scientific fields. Some engineering cards allow players to repair vipers and locations aboard Galactica.
- Treachery: This skill represents nefarious and underhanded tactics. Unlike other Skill types, it is primarily used by Cylon players. 

At the end of *any player's* turn, a player with more than 10 Skill Cards must discard down to 10. When discarded, Skill Cards go face up next to their respective deck. When a deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck. 

#### Destiny Deck

To create the Destiny deck, take two of each type of Skill Card (including Treachery, if present) and shuffle. These are used in each Skill Check to add uncertainty and plausible deniability for hidden Cylons. After the last card is used from the Destiny deck, form a new one.

### Crisis card resolution

1. Draw Crisis card 
- Reveal Crisis card and read it
   - Starbuck's "Secret Destiny" takes place before Baltar's "Delusional Intuition" (Baltar's text should really say "after revealing")
- Resolve "Player Chooses" event, if any
   - Lee Adama's "Choose a Different Path" adds a new choice that *may* be chosen
    - Helo’s "Moral Compass" forces a specific choice that *must* be chosen
- Follow the Skill Check procedure if a Skill Check has been chosen

When making a "Player Chooses" decision, unless specifically stated otherwise a player may select which box gets resolved even if they know that they will not be able to actually fulfill that option. For example, if the choice is between "lose 1 morale" and "the President discards 5 Skill cards", the second option can be chosen even if the President has no Skill cards.

While resolving a choice, if directed to choose a player to move to the Brig or Sickbay, a player must be chosen who can actually be moved to that location if possible (in other words, not players who are already there, players with restricted movement, or revealed Cylons). If, however, the effect does not provide a choice, like "Send the President to Sickbay", and that character cannot be moved there, nothing happens. 

When resolving a result with multiple Cylon activations, resolve them in left to right order. 

### Super Crisis Cards
Super Crisis cards are resolved like Crisis cards but they are not Crisis cards, so any ability that states that it affects Crisis cards does not apply. They are also immune to character abilities that affect Skill Checks. 

### Skill Check resolution

1. The Skill check begins
    - Resolve any abilities that cause the entire check to pass or fail without any attempt required, such as "Political Prowess" or Boomer's "Mysterious Intuition"
2. The "pre-card" abilities can now occur, with the exact order chosen by the current player
    - This includes abilities with text that says: 
        - "before making a skill check"
        - "before cards are added to a Skill check"
        - "when a player activates [some location]"
    - "Restore Order" prevents Reckless cards from being played afterward, and vice versa
    - When Dee uses her "Fast Learner" to add cards to the Skill check, they aren't *officially* added until after the Destiny deck's cards. This means that more "pre-card" effects can be played even after "Fast Learner" has been used. 
    - Players can receive new cards from "Support the People" and use them as additional "pre-card" effects as well
    - When the current player chooses an effect to go first, the rejected effect can be withdrawn. If it was on a card, the owner takes the card back.
3. Add cards from the Destiny deck (followed by Dee's "Fast Learner" cards if any)
4. Starting to the left of the current player and proceeding clockwise, each player plays into the Skill check. 
5. Shuffle the Skill check cards
6. Reveal the Skill check cards 
    - Caprica Six's "Human Delusion" occurs before Cally's "Quick Fix" if both are attempted
7. Resolve Skill Check Abilities, with the order being chosen by the current player.
    - "Reckless Skill Check" abilities only take effect if the Skill Check was made Reckless
    - The effects from cards with the same name are not resolved more than once in this step. Any subsequent duplicates are ignored. 
    - If a card is removed after its effect has taken place, the effect still remains. (For example, if "All Hands on Deck" is resolved but removed later, all 0 strength cards still count as strength 1 later on.)
    - "Red Tape" and "Quick Thinking" refer to the printed value on the card only, not values after any modification.
8. If the Skill Check was made Reckless, but the "Mutiny" Treachery deck from Daybreak is being used (which contains no Reckless Skill Check Abilities), do the following:
    1. Draw 1 Treachery card
    - If it is strength 0:
        - Draw 1 more Treachery card
        - Resolve both Skill Check Abilities, even if they are duplicates of other abilities that have already been resolved
        - Remove both cards from the check and discard them. They do not count toward the Skill check's strength.
    - If it is not strength 0, it is discarded with no effects.
9. Trigger Consequences, if any
    - Consequences are resolved if at "least 1 Skill Card with a Skill Check Ability icon was played into the check". They are indicated by a "Skill Check Ability" icon on the Crisis card, similar to the "Pass" and "Fail" results. 
10. Total the net strength of the cards (positive minus negative), taking into account any effects that modified them
11. Determine outcome: Pass, partial pass, or fail
    - "A Second Chance" now applies if it was played
13. Resolve the outcome
    - "Install Upgrades" now applies if it was played
14. Discard Skill cards into their appropriate discard piles
    - William Adama may override this with "Command Authority"


### Activating Cylon ships

Appropriately, Cylon ships follow certain programming when activated. Revealed Cylon players don't control these ships directly. 

When Cylon ships are activated, they are resolved one entire space area at a time. When multiple space areas are affected, the current player chooses what order they are resolved in (and sometimes this makes a difference!). If a Cylon ship moves to another space area that hasn't been resolved yet, it isn't activated a second time. Make sure to keep it separate from the ships that haven't been activated yet. 

If there are not enough tokens to place ships on the board, the current player chooses which to place, and the rest are skipped due to component limitations. When the Cylon Fleet board is present and a ship must be placed on the main board, first draw from the regular reserves if possible, then draw from the Cylon Fleet board starting in the lowest numbered space. This does not move other ships in the space area and does not increase the Pursuit track. 

When these icons appear on a Crisis card, do the following:

- Activate raiders: Each Cylon raider is activated once. If there are no raiders on the board, each basestar launches two new raiders. If there are no raiders and no basestars on the board, **nothing happens on the main board**. 
- Launch raiders: Each basestar launches 3 raiders. If there are no basestars, **nothing happens on the main board**.
- Activate heavy raiders and Centurions: Follow the procedure for activating heavy raiders and Centurions. If there are no basestars, centurions, or heavy raiders, **nothing happens on the main board**. 
- Activate basestars: Each basestar attacks Galactica. If there are no basestars, **nothing happens on the main board**. 

When playing with the Cylon Fleet option, the phrase "**nothing happens on the main board**" means that something happens on the Cylon Fleet board instead: 

- Note the appropriate ship based on the Activate Cylon Ships icon:
    - Activate Raiders: 1 raider
    - Activate Heavy Raiders/Centurions: 1 heavy raider
    - Launch Raiders or Activate Basestars: 1 basestar
- If there is an appropriate ship in the reserves, then roll a die and place that ship in the appropriate Cylon space area
    - This die roll **may** be affected by game effects or abilities
- Otherwise, if all ships of the appropriate type are already on the main board or the Cylon Fleet board:
    - Find the highest numbered Cylon space area containing the appropriate ship, and move *all* ships from that space area to the corresponding area on the main board.
    - If the appropriate ship is not on the Cylon Fleet board at all, no ships move over.
- Finally, advance the Cylon pursuit marker one space. 
    - If it has reached a space with civilian ships underneath it, the CAG must place the indicated number of civilian ships on the main board. 
    - If it has reached "Auto Attack", move *all* ships in Cylon space areas to their corresponding main space areas and reset the Cylon pursuit marker. 

Note that, for example, if raiders are launched, but the only basestar has been damaged and can no longer launch raiders, this does *not* trigger any action on the Cylon Fleet board because the basestar tried to attack but failed. The Cylon Fleet board is also not triggered when nothing happens on the board solely due to component limitations, because the current player tried to execute the action but could not. It is only triggered when the  phrase "**nothing happens on the main game board**" is specified as the end result because the condition immediately preceding it was true. 

### Jumping the fleet

The human fleet normally jumps by either activating the "FTL Control" location on Galactica, or having the fleet token reach "Auto-Jump". 

When "FTL Control" is used to jump, the current player (not the player who activated "FTL Control") must first roll a die, and on a 6 or lower, the population indicated by the current Jump Preparation space is lost (either -3 or -1). After this is finished, the jump can begin. 

The procedure for jumping is:

1. If the Demetrius is present, follow the instructions on the Active Mission space. 
- All ships on the game board are removed and returned to their respective pile, the Reserves, etc. unless otherwise specified. Pilots who were flying ships move to the Hanger Deck. Centurions are *not* removed. 
    - With the Cylon Fleet board, do *not* remove civilian ships, and Cylon ships do not go back to their piles, instead they are moved to the respective space area on the Cylon Fleet board. Basestar damage tokens are removed and returned to the unused pile. 
    - Pilots of assault raptors may choose to remain in space during this step. The current player may choose to keep unmanned assault raptors in space during this step. 
- The Admiral draws 2 Destination cards, chooses 1, and places the other on the bottom of the Destination deck. 
- Follow the instructions on the chosen Destination card. 
- If the Objective card specifies something that happens at this new distance, resolve that event completely.
- Reset the Jump Preparation track to the start. 
    - If the "Crossroads" phase was just resolved, skip this step.

### Character sheets

Each character's sheet lists these items:

- Type. Used for selecting a well-rounded group of characters to start.
-  Abilities. These include
    - A standard ability, which may be an Action or a passive trait.
    - A "once-per-game" ability, which can only be used once per game (but see "Miracle tokens" below). 
    - A negative ability which must be followed during the game.
- Skill Set. These are the types of cards that your character draws. When instructed to draw Skill Cards, *they must come from your skill set* unless otherwise instructed. 
- Setup instructions. This tells you how to start the game with your character. 

A character ability that affects Crisis cards or Skill checks does *not* affect a Super Crisis card. 

#### Notes

When Helo re-rolls a die that had "Strategic Planning" applied to it, the re-roll also receives +2 to the result. Players may also choose to apply "Strategic Planning" to the re-roll if it wasn't used originally. 

Helo's "Moral Compass" allows him to choose which box is resolved on a "[Someone] Chooses" Crisis. He cannot, however, influence a "choice within a choice", for example, if the chosen box says that the President must either give up their title or go to the Brig. In a situation like that, Helo gets to choose which box gets resolved, but he doesn't have additional power over its resolution.  

If Helena Cain uses "Blind Jump" while a "Mission Specialist" is assigned, ignore the "Mission Specialist" instructions for that jump, leaving it in place for later.

When "Kat" uses her "Hot Shot" ability, there is no die roll, so cards that affect die rolls cannot be used. An attack on a basestar with structural damage does not get +2 with "Hot Shot" for the same reason. 

If Ellen Tigh steals a title using "Manipulative" but then loses it before the end of her turn, she is no longer capable of following the instruction to return it and it therefore stays with whoever now has it. If she attempts to return it but the player it belonged to is no longer capable of holding the title, it goes to the first in the appropriate line of succession. If she became President again during her "Manipulative" turn through some other action, she must still follow the instruction to return the title at the end of her turn. She cannot use "Manipulative" to become Admiral if she is in the Brig. 

Hoshi's "Reluctant" weakness also applies to Movement actions on Skill cards (as does any game effect that affects actions of a particular type). His "Dutiful" ability can be used once for *each* location listed. So, for example, if he used his "Organized" once-per-game on those 3 locations, he could also use "Dutiful" each time on them.

Tom Zarek (Military)'s "Necessary Steps" applies to all players, even himself, and even applies at the start of the game when he draws a Mutiny card due to his "Disreputable" weakness. 

Lee Adama (Political)'s "Choose a Different Path" creates a new, additional option on "X Chooses" cards. If Helo uses "Moral Compass", he forces the choice to a different one. Therefore, Lee could use "Different Path" to create a new option (and presumably choose it), and Helo could force his choice to something else. But if Helo uses "Moral Compass", Lee cannot then use "Different Path" to change away from Helo's choice, because "Different Path" would simply add a new option, not force Helo to choose it. 

Doc Cottle can use *abilities* on Engineering cards, just not actions (and not Movement actions either). 

Athena's "For Love" ability cannot be used in the following cases:

- A player is discarding down to their hand limit (as mentioned on the sheet)
- A Super Crisis card is being resolved
- A player is discarding to resolve a character ability, like Kat's "Hotshot", Hoshi's "Dutiful", and Anders's "Star Player". 

D'Anna's "Visions" ability, when used in the Brig or Detention, does not require discarding down to 3 cards since it is not using the Infiltrator's special "return to the Resurrection Ship" Action. 

Doral's "Meticulous" ability does not allow him to choose the Resurrection Ship as his destination. This is because the Resurrection Ship is Hazardous, and the instruction to "move to any Cylon Location" does not explicitly include the Resurrection Ship as a potential destination.  

O'Neill's "Modifications" takes place during the "Activate Cylon Ships" step. Players still have this step even when they are in the Brig or used their turn to activate a Mission so even though a Crisis card wasn't drawn, O'Neill can still use this action. 

### Miracle tokens

In Daybreak, "once-per-game" doesn't actually mean once per game. Instead, characters must spend a Miracle token in order to use their once per game ability. Daybreak includes some game effects that can allow players to regain a spent Miracle token, allowing them to use their "once per game" ability more than once. 

There is a limit of 1 Miracle token per player. Players who already have one cannot gain another.  The only exception is Alternate Gaius Baltar who can hold up to 3, and needs to spend 3 to use his "Miracle ability". 

Even when not playing with Daybreak, it's convenient to use Miracle tokens to track whether each player has used their once-per-game or not. Without any game effects to regain them, it ends up being the same as the regular rules (with the exception that players should not discard their token when executed, since executed players do not lose their once-per-game unless Daybreak is being used). 

### Loyalty cards

Players receive Loyalty cards at the beginning of the game and at the Sleeper Agent phase. Players must keep them secret unless another player is directed to look at them, not discussing their text or any other details other than claiming to be human or Cylon. Players may *imply* that good or bad things will happen (for example, "I wouldn't examine my Loyalty cards if I were you") but may not explicitly say that they have certain types of cards. 

When a player is allowed to examine just one from another player, it is chosen randomly. When instructed to inspect Loyalty cards, players must choose a face down Loyalty card that doesn't belong to themselves if possible. If this is not possible, for example a player who is President and Admiral being instructed to inspect the President or Admiral's Loyalty card, nothing happens. 

A player is a Cylon if *any* of their Loyalty card states "You Are A Cylon". Having both a "Cylon" and "Not A Cylon" means that you *are* a Cylon. 

When a game element refers to "players", it is talking about all individuals currently playing the game. "Human players" are players who are not revealed Cylons. Even if a player is concealing a "You Are a Cylon" card, they are still treated as a human until they reveal. "Cylon players" refers only to revealed Cylons. Cylon Leaders straddle this line, being considered "human players" in all respects (with some limitations) when Infiltrating, and "Cylon players" when not Infiltrating. 

#### Personal Goal cards

A Personal Goal card counts as a "Not a Cylon" card, but adds a secret goal for that character to accomplish which probably goes against the humans' goals. They require an _extra-card_ style Loyalty deck, where 1 card is always left over. 

Personal Goals can be revealed as an action as long as certain conditions are met. After revealing, if the distance is 6 or less, the player should then shuffle 1 card from the "Not a Cylon" deck into the Loyalty deck and draw 1 new Loyalty card. 

If a human player has not revealed it by the end of the game, the resource listed on the card is reduced which could cause the humans to lose at the last minute. If a revealed Cylon player has an unrevealed Personal Goal, resources are *not* lost.

#### Final Five cards

A Final Five card counts as a "Not a Cylon" card, but can trigger special negative effects when revealed or examined. (Thematically, the Final Five are supposed to be Cylons, but they are not like the other seven and so they count as human for game purposes.)

When a player looks at another's Loyalty card and it turns out to be a Final Five card, they must immediately reveal it and return it to the other player, who resolves the text on the card, turns it face down again, and shuffles it with their other Loyalty cards if any. 

If, during an execution, a Final Five card is revealed, the text on the card is resolved by the executed player and the Final Five card is removed from the game. 

The current player may choose the order in which to resolve Final Five cards, but they must *all* be resolved, even if one of them causes the player who examined the Final Five cards to be executed midway through. 

Abilities on Final Five cards do not affect Cylon players. 

#### The Sympathizer
This card is sometimes added to the Loyalty deck after the first round of cards go out (so it will probably, but not always, appear in the Sleeper Agent phase). As it states on the card, this Loyalty card is immediately revealed and resolved when dealt to a human player. If any resource is in the red zone, The Sympathizer is sent to the Brig but remains a human player. If there are no resources in the red zone, The Sympathizer follows the procedure for revealing as a Cylon player, and plays as a (restricted) Cylon the rest of the game. 

This card is somewhat controversial -- it attempts to be a sort of "half-Cylon", but The Sympathizer is limited in what they can do as a Cylon, and they don't get to sneak around pretending to be human at all, since they're revealed right away. There is an official "No Sympathizer" variant, handicapping the humans to making the Sympathizer unnecessary, which is described in the Loyalty deck section. Many of the expansions contain ways to replace The Sympathizer with something else as well (Cylon Leaders, The Mutineer, Sympathetic Cylon). 

#### Sympathetic Cylon

This card is similar to The Sympathizer, as described above. It is included in the Loyalty deck after the first round of cards go out, so it will probably appear in the Sleeper Agent phase. However, the Sympathetic Cylon is more like a mini-Cylon Leader. 

As stated on the card, the Sympathetic Cylon card is immediately revealed when dealt to a human player. The player reveals as a Cylon, but also draws a Sympathetic Agenda card (the ones with 4-6 and Caprica Six on the back). Like a Cylon Leader, the Sympathetic Cylon must meet the conditions on the card to win. They are also allowed to Infiltrate, following the same rules as a Cylon Leader. While Infiltrating, since they no longer have a Skill set, they draw as they would as a Cylon (drawing Skill cards of different types) but with a 1 card bonus, for a total of 3 Skill cards of different types. 

#### The Mutineer

The Mutineer card replaces both of the Sympathizer cards described above. It is always treated as a "Not a Cylon" card. The player with this card is referred to as "the Mutineer". 

Whenever a player receives the Mutineer card, they must reveal the card. If it was received from the Loyalty deck, not another player, they must then draw another Loyalty card to replace it. Then, they must draw 1 Mutiny card and are stripped of any Titles that they hold. (This only happens when receiving the card. The Mutineer is allowed to gain or lose titles after that as normal.)

During the "Prepare for Jump" step of the Mutineer's turn, if the Crisis card has a "prepare for jump" icon, the Mutineer must draw a Mutiny card. 

The Mutineer is allowed to hold 2 Mutiny cards without being sent to the Brig, and may hold 2 Mutiny cards in the Brig instead of 1. 

### Mutiny cards

Mutiny cards provide Actions to players, usually with both some benefit and some drawback. They are kept secret from other players, and discarded face up next to the Mutiny deck. 

Mutiny cards cannot be drawn or played by revealed Cylons, and revealed Cylons cannot be selected as the target of an effect that says to draw Mutiny cards. 

#### Drawing a second Mutiny card

When a player draws a second Mutiny card, they are immediately sent to the Brig unless specifically told not to do so (or incapable of moving to the Brig, such as when "Helo" is Stranded.)

Any player with multiple Mutiny cards must immediately choose one and discard the rest. 

#### Discarding Treachery cards and gaining Mutiny cards

Some Treachery cards say to draw a Mutiny card if they are chosen to be discarded. Players are considered to have "chosen" whenever they discard unless either

- a game effect directed them to choose randomly, or
- they were specifically instructed to discard "all" of their Skill cards, no number was given.

Note that if a player is instructed to discard a specific number of cards, it is considered a choice even if they will have to discard all of their cards to reach that number.

Within one turn, a player does not draw more than 1 Mutiny card as a result of discarding Treachery. After the first Mutiny card is received, that text is ignored on subsequent cards for the rest of the turn. 

Cards being discarded after being added to a Skill check do not count as being chosen by anyone. Playing a card into a Skill check is not the same as discarding it.


### Trauma Tokens

Trauma Tokens are used in the Ionian Nebula option. Each one represents a hardship that the character is encountering and how the character reacted to it. The "benevolent" symbol represents compassion or belief in destiny. This can be beneficial to humans, but may alienate a Cylon from the other models. The "antagonistic" symbol represents bitterness or agression, which can be harmful to human players. The "disaster" symbol represents a tragedy. 

When drawing a Trauma Token:

- Look at the token. If it is not a "disaster" token, keep it next to your character sheet face down with any other tokens and do not reveal it to anyone.
- If it is a "disaster" token, reveal it.
   - If you are a human player, your character is executed, and the "disaster" token is returned to the pool. 
   - A revealed Cylon draws 2 more Trauma Tokens, then puts any "disaster" tokens back into the pool. (Note that those 2 new tokens could contain another "disaster", requiring 2 *more* tokens, etc.)

When instructed to draw multiple Trauma tokens, draw all of them at once, not one at a time, before resolving any "disaster" tokens.

#### Trauma tokens on locations

If a player starts their turn on a location with a Trauma Token, such as the Brig or Sickbay, they draw that token at the start of their turn and replace it with a new token from the pool.

### Ally cards

Ally cards represent other characters in the fleet who can help or hurt. They appear in various locations and have an associated Trauma token which indicates what they do when encountered. When a player ends their Movement step in a location with an Ally, they *must* encounter it. 

To encounter an Ally: 

- Reveal the Trauma Token on that Ally's card. Follow the action on the card that is indicated by the token. If it is a "disaster" icon, do not resolve either action. The player encountering the Ally is not affected.
- Remove the Ally card and token from the game. 
- Discard the revealed Trauma token. 
- Draw a new Ally card, and place its corresponding token on the indicated location.
- The player who encountered the Ally chooses one of *their own* Trauma tokens and places it on the new Ally card without revealing it. If they have no Trauma tokens, use one from the pool without examining it. 

#### Placing a new Ally

Allies are always removed from the game if a player has used or is using the corresponding character for themselves. This includes characters that were played but have since been executed. When this occurs, keep drawing Allies to replace the removed Ally until one is found that has not been used. The new Ally gets a Trauma token, but the source depends on why the new Ally is being drawn. Remember that "Boomer" and "Athena" are *not* duplicates of each other, so they may coexist within the same game. 

The Ally deck can be depleted, at which point no new Allies are placed. 

#### Ally replaced with player, or location damaged

If a player chooses a character after an execution that corresponds with an Ally currently on the board, or if a location containing an Ally is damaged or destroyed, the Ally is removed from the game (without revealing the Trauma token) and replaced as usual. The Cylon player with the most Trauma tokens chooses one of *their own* tokens to place on the new Ally. If there is a tie for most tokens, the current player chooses which one places the token. If there are no Cylon players with tokens, use a random one from the pool. 

### Cylon Leaders

A Cylon Leader is a special player who plays with their own motives and agenda. In addition to being aligned with the winning team, a Cylon Leader will also need to accomplish their own goal(s), adding an extra challenge. These extra goals cannot be discussed or revealed, other than discussing which side the Cylon Leader is trying to help or hurt. 

With an Agenda card, the Cylon Leader needs to satisfy *all* conditions listed on the card in order to win. 

With Motive cards, the Cylon Leader receives 2 at the start of the game and 2 more at the Sleeper Agent phase. Each one has 2 components, an allegiance and a condition. The Cylon Leader may reveal a Motive card at any time as long as its condition is *currently* being met, even in the middle of an action or Crisis. If it *was* met before but is not anymore, it cannot be revealed. In order to win with Motive cards, at the end of the game the Cylon Leader must have at least 3 Motive cards revealed, and at least 2 of the revealed cards must be aligned with the winning team. 

Cylon Leaders are generally treated like and follow the rules for revealed Cylons. Unlike revealed Cylons, Leaders keep and use their character sheets. Just like other players, they must draw from their Skill set unless otherwise specified. They also have positive abilities at their disposal, including a "once per game" or Miracle ability, and negative abilities which are followed at all times. 

Cylon Leaders are also allowed to Infiltrate by using the "Human Fleet" location. The "Infiltrating" card summarizes the rules for Infiltrating. While Infiltrating, Cylon Leaders follow the rules for *human* players, and are treated as human players in all respects, with the following exceptions: 

- Infiltrators draw 1 extra Skill card (from their Skill set, of course) when they draw cards, for a total of 3.
- Infiltrators cannot hold titles. 
    - They may be assigned Quorum cards like "Mission Specialist" or "Arbitrator", since those are not titles, with the exception of "Vice President" since that requires the ability to become President. 
- Infiltrators may not play more than 2 cards into a Skill check. 
- The Infiltrator always has this Action available to them:
    - Move to the Resurrection Ship. If your character was in the Brig or Detention, discard down to 3 Skill cards before moving. 
- Any time an Infiltrator moves to the Resurrection Ship, either voluntarily using the above action or because of another game effect, they are no longer Infiltrating. They must discard any cards that a revealed Cylon cannot hold. 

Cylon Leaders always win or lose based on their agenda/motives, regardless of whether they are Infiltrating or not. 

Cylon Leaders ignore game effects that tell them to add cards to the Loyalty Deck and/or draw from it, since they don't use Loyalty cards. 

### Cylon Players

A Cylon player is a player who has revealed as a Cylon (or a Cylon Leader who is not Infiltrating). Human players who have a hidden "You Are a Cylon" card are secretly Cylons, but until they reveal they are still treated as human players and not Cylon players. 

Cylon players may choose to ignore:

- Abilities on Crisis cards and Skill Checks, unless they specifically say that they apply to Cylon players
- Abilities on Final Five cards
- Being forced to discard Skill cards

Cylon players are not allowed to:

- Move to non-Cylon locations (or be sent to the Brig or Sickbay)
- Use actions on non-Treachery Skill cards, Quorum cards, Mutiny cards, or their old human character sheet, including their once per game/Miracle ability. They *are* allowed to use the actions on Treachery cards.
- Be the target of an Executive Order. (If a Cylon reveals as the first action of an Executive Order, they are not allowed to use the second action.)
- Contribute more than 1 card to Skill Checks

A Cylon is allowed to make use of the State of Emergency action when it is played, since it targets all players and not a specific player. If a Cylon uses a State of Emergency to activate Caprica and play a Crisis card, resolve the Crisis fully, however the "Prepare for Jump" step is deferred until the end of the turn. At the end of the turn, resolve any and all "Prepare for Jump" icons from Crisis cards played during that turn one at a time. Cylon ship activations on Crisis cards are also deferred to the end of the turn, and are resolved during the regular "Activate Cylon Ships" step in the order that they were drawn. 

In addition, State of Emergency continues to execute even if the player who played it uses it to reveal as a Cylon. 

#### Cylon Reveal resolution
Revealing as a Cylon is an Action, as described on the "You Are A Cylon" Loyalty card. It can also happen involuntarily, for example as the result of an execution. 

1. Complete the Action listed on the "You Are a Cylon" card. Note that it says to only reveal "this" card, not others. Keep any other Loyalty cards secret!
- Discard your hand of Skill cards down to 3. 
- Discard any Quorum cards attached to your character (these are cards like "Assign Vice President", not the *hand* of Quorum cards), any Mutiny cards, and any Miracle tokens.
- Lose any titles to the character highest in the line of succession for that title. All resources that are tied to that title (the hand of Quorum cards, nuke tokens, Destinations) travel with the title as-is, they are not discarded. 
- Move to the Resurrection Ship location. If piloting a ship, that ship is returned to the Reserves.
- Unless otherwise directed, receive a Super Crisis Card.
- If you were the Mutineer, hand off the Mutineer card to the human player of your choice. They must follow the procedure for revealing the Mutineer card. 
- If there is a "Cylon Locations" overlay on the board, and the fleet has traveled 6 or less distance, look at the rest of your Loyalty cards, if any. Hand them all, face down, to *one* human player of your choice. 
    - If there is no overlay, the Resurrection Ship location will allow you to do this later as an action. 
- As a Cylon, you do not resolve a Crisis at the end of your turn anymore, so if you revealed as your normal Action, end your turn without drawing a Crisis card. 

#### Cylon game turn

A revealed Cylon player has a modified game turn. 

- Draw 2 Skill cards
    - According to the base game, these can be of any two types. In all 3 expansions, this is changed: the two cards must be of *different* types. 
    - As a revealed Cylon, your old human Skill set is ignored
- Movement step: 
    - Cylon players may move to Cylon locations, but not human ones
    - Any "Movement:" action that is available to a Cylon, such as those on Treachery skill cards or on a Cylon Leader's character sheet, may be used during this step instead of moving to a new location
- Action: 
    - Cylons may use the action listed on their current Cylon location, on their Cylon Leader character sheet, or on Treachery Skill cards, but *not* old human character abilities or other Skill cards. 
- Prepare for Jump:
    - If a Crisis card was played, resolve the "Prepare for Jump" icon as normal. 
    - Skip this step when playing *just* the base game with no expansions whatsoever. See the "Caprica" location section below. 
- End turn. Do not draw a Crisis card. All players must apply the 10 Skill card hand limit. If any resource is at 0 or below, the humans lose. 

#### Cylon Locations

##### The "Caprica" location

The text on "Caprica" indicates that when a Cylon draws two Crisis cards and chooses 1, the "Activate Cylon Ships" step and "Prepare for Jump" step are both skipped. However, *all three expansions* change this so that the "Prepare for Jump" step is no longer skipped. This is especially important to note when playing with just Exodus, since it does not have an updated Cylon Locations overlay but *does* indicate the rule change in the book on page 9. 

##### Cylon Fleet location

When choosing to "activate all Cylon ships of one type", the chosen activation is resolved exactly as it is when it appears on a Crisis card, including moving Centurions if heavy raiders are activated. This also includes following the Cylon Fleet board rules for when "nothing happens on the main board". 

The other option, "launch 2 raiders and 1 heavy raider from each basestar" does exactly that and nothing more. The Cylon Fleet board is only involved if the regular piles have run out of raiders or heavy raiders, in which case they are drawn from the lowest numbered Cylon Fleet spaces as usual. Basestars on the Cylon Fleet board do *not* launch ships as a result of this action, only basestars on the main board. Since it is not an "Activate Cylon Ships" icon that is being resolved, the Pursuit track is not advanced and Cylon Fleet space areas are not moved over to the main board. 

##### Basestar Bridge

The Basestar Bridge on the Cylon Fleet board is a Cylon location, only accessible to Cylon players. It is *not* necessary to discard a Skill card to move to the Basestar Bridge. 

The two abilities that are chosen must be decided *before* resolving either of them. The activating player may not switch after the first has been resolved. (For most other game decisions, players may make their choices as they go.)

Attempting to use the Basestar Bridge to place a basestar on the Cylon Fleet board when both basestars are already placed on one of the two boards does nothing. Both basestars remain wherever they are. 

### Locations

Players may only move to hazardous locations via game effects, not their normal movements. This includes the "Resurrection Ship" when playing with a Cylon Locations overlay.

#### Commmand

The wording on Command should probably be: "Perform up to 2 unmanned viper activations", because you are allowed to target the same viper twice. This also means that you may launch a viper for the first activation and then activate it again for the second. 

#### The Brig

Players may only move out of the Brig if they pass the Brig's Skill Check, or an effect *specifically* says to move a player out of the Brig. For example, a card that says "send the President to Sickbay" cannot be used to transfer the President from the Brig. If, however, it said "move a character from the Brig to Sickbay", it would be allowed. In particular, Kat's "Stim Junkie" weakness does not move her to Sickbay, and Lee Adama cannot use "Alert Viper Pilot" to leave the Brig. 

The text on the board says that characters can move to "any location" after passing the Skill check, but the rules say on page 18 that they can move to any location *on Galactica*. 

Players may use any Action they wish in the Brig. They are also allowed to use "Movement: " actions during their Movement phase. The only restrictions that apply to them are on leaving the Brig and on playing cards into Skill checks. 

#### Moving players to Sickbay/Brig

When a game effect forces a choice of which character to send to Sickbay or the Brig, the end result must be a character moving from somewhere else to that location if possible. Unless every single character is either in the destination or has restricted movement, you cannot for example choose to send a character already in Sickbay as the target of "send someone to Sickbay", or choose a revealed Cylon player knowing that they cannot be sent to Sickbay. 

However, if the effect specifies a certain player, like the President, and that player cannot be moved or is already in that location, the effect may be chosen even though it cannot be accomplished. For example, if given a choice between "Lose 2 morale" and "send the President to Sickbay", the second option can be chosen even if the President cannot be moved to Sickbay. 


### Titles

Titles can only be held by human players, not Cylon players or Cylon Leaders. When a human is revealed to be a Cylon, the first player in the line of succession for that title claims it. This only occurs when a title is stripped, not automatically. For example, if a human player who was not Admiral is executed and comes back as Helena Cain, they do not become Admiral even though they are highest in the line of succession. However, if the Admiral revealed as a Cylon, or was sent to the Brig, then Cain would receive the title when it gets re-allocated since she is first in the line of succession. 

#### President
The President controls the hand of Quorum cards and gets to make some choices on Crisis Cards. 

The hand of Quorum cards follows the President title if a new character becomes President. Quorum cards that have already been drawn into the President's hand are given to the new President, they are not discarded and they are not kept by the outgoing President. Quorum cards should be kept secret from other players until used. The President title card provides an additional action to draw Quorum cards, and some locations can only be used by the President. 

The base game specifies that there is no limit to the number of Quorum cards the President can have in their hand, but every expansion overrides that and imposes a 10 card hand limit. 

The "Consult the Oracle" card cannot be used on the Loyalty deck, the Agenda deck, or the Motive deck. 

#### Admiral

The Admiral controls the humans' nuke tokens and can use them with the Action on the title card. The Admiral also chooses the destination when a jump occurs, and makes choices that specify the Admiral. In addition, if a game effect states that a civilian ship is to be placed, but does not specify a specific area, and there is no CAG, the Admiral may choose which area. Unlike the CAG, when the Admiral does this there is no restriction on which space area to choose. 

If the Admiral is in the Brig, they are stripped of their title. The highest human player in the line of succession then claims it. The Admiral does not regain their title automatically upon leaving the Brig. If all eligible players are in the Brig, it goes to the highest in the line of succession until a player leaves the Brig. The Admiral still retains their title if they are sent to Detention on New Caprica.

#### CAG (Commander, Air Group)

The CAG title is only used when playing with the Cylon Fleet option. The CAG makes some Crisis decisions, and also takes over one of the Admiral's normal duties: placing civilian ships on the game board when no space area is specified. This typically occurs as a result of the Pursuit track advancing. 

When a game effects says to place a civilain ship on the board, but does not specify a specific space area, the CAG places the ship on the board. The CAG must choose a space area *without* a civilian ship already in it, if possible. 

The CAG follows the same rules as the Admiral when sent to the Brig (but not Detention): they are stripped of their title and do not automatically regain it upon leaving the Brig.

</table>

With the Cylon Fleet board, a nuke targets an entire space area instead of a single basestar:

- 1–2: Damage a basestar twice
- 3–6: Destroy a basestar
- 7: Destroy a basestar and 3 raiders
- 8: Destroy every ship in the space area

### Human combat ships

When human ships are destroyed, they are removed from the game entirely. 

#### Civilian ships

Civilian ship tiles represent ships in the human fleet. Civilian ships have no defense; when attacked they are immediately destroyed with no die roll. The ship is turned over to reveal its contents. The humans lose the indicated resources (usually population) and the ship token is removed from the game. 

When an event instructs players to "draw a civilian ship and destroy it", they are drawn from the stockpile of ships next to the board first, not the main game board. If the only civilian ships left are those on the main board, however, the current player must choose one to destroy. During the New Caprica phase, draw ships to be destroyed from the regular pile first, then the Locked civilian ship stack, then the Prepared civilian ship stack, and finally the main game board. (Note that this is *only* for drawing a civilian ship to destroy it, not for any other placement or drawing of civilian ships.)

When instructed to place a civilain ship and no space area is specified, the CAG places it in an area without a civilian ship if possible. If there is no CAG, the Admiral may place it in any space area. During the New Caprica phase, when a ship is evacuated, the current player chooses which of the two space areas to place it in (bottom left or bottom right). 

#### Raptors

Raptors aren't used in space areas. Instead, certain game actions will "risk" them (presumably, you are sending them on a dangerous mission to deep space), and a failure will cause them to be destroyed. Just like the other human ships, when destroyed they are removed from the game. Unlike every other ship, raptors may still be risked during the New Caprica phase before Galactica returns to orbit. 

#### Vipers

When instructed to activate a viper, perform one of the following actions:

- Launch: Take a viper from the Reserves and place it in one of the two space areas with a viper launch icon
- Move a viper to an adjacent space area. (There is no flying "above" or "below" Galactica, even though this is outer space.)
- Have a viper attack a Cylon ship in the same space area. 
- When using the Cylon Fleet expansion, a viper may escort a civilian ship in its space area, moving it back to the pile next to the board. 

When damaged, a viper goes into the "Damaged Viper" box on the board. It may not be launched or used until it is repaired. 

An Evasive Maneuver cannot be used when a viper is damaged by the Main Batteries because it is not being attacked. 

Under the effects of "Gravity Well", a Skill card must be discarded to activate a viper. For "Command", or any other card that allows a player to activate a viper, 1 card must be discarded for each activation. Actions that allow for moving or attacking with a viper, like "Maximum Firepower" or "Full Throttle", only require 1 card to perform the entire action even if it involves multiple attacks or moves. A pilot moving their own ship during their Movement step or with an Executive Order is not an activation and does not require a discard. 


#### Mark VII Vipers

The mark VII is a more advanced model of viper, included when playing the Cylon Fleet module. Although they start out damaged, when repaired they are more powerful than regular vipers. Except where noted here, they are treated the same as vipers for all game effects. 

When moving, a mark VII viper may move two space areas instead of 1. This includes both manned and unmanned vipers. A mark VII viper is damaged on a 6 or 7, and destroyed on an 8. 

When placing, destroying, or activating vipers, the current player may choose to use a mark VII if one is available. A pilot launching in a viper may also choose a mark VII viper. 

#### Assualt raptors

Assault raptors are treated as vipers, not raptors, for all game effects. They are raptors that have been upgraded for combat instead of reconaissance, and cannot be used to "risk a raptor". Just like mark VII vipers, they can be chosen by players in place of a viper when activating, launching, placing, or destroying a viper. 

Assault raptors are destroyed on a 7 or an 8 and are never damaged. If instructed to "damage a viper" and an assault raptor is chosen as the target, it is destroyed. 

When the fleet jumps, a character piloting an assault raptor may choose to stay in their space area. For unmanned assault raptors, the current player may choose for them to remain in space. 

#### Piloting

Any character with piloting in their skill set is allowed to fly a viper themselves. They should have a piloting token, used to represent which viper they are flying. These are manned vipers, as opposed to unmanned ones. 

While piloting, players have the option of using their Movement step to move their viper to an adjacent space area. During Movement, players can also land their viper and move to a ship location  at the cost of discarding 1 Skill Card (their viper goes back into the reserves). 

During their Action step, the player may choose to activate their own viper as their Action. This could mean moving twice in one turn, first as a move and the second as a viper activation. Note that landing a viper is *not* available as an Action, it is strictly a move. 

If a player is sent to Sickbay or the Brig while piloting, they are moved there and their ship goes back to the Reserves.  

A piloted viper cannot be activated by another player using Command. 

### Cylon combat ships

Cylon ships are never permanently destroyed. When they are destroyed, put them back next to the game board for reuse later. They are not piloted, nor are their actions controlled directly by Cylon players. 

#### Raiders
When a Cylon raider is activated, it does the first available action in this list:

1. Attack an unmanned viper in its space area
- Attack a manned viper in its space area
- Destroy a civilian ship in its space area
- Move one space area closer to the nearest civilian ship. If two such space areas are equal in distance, the raider moves clockwise. 
- If there are no civilian ships, the raider attacks Galactica. 

Scar is a special raider. He can only be destroyed as the result of a die roll of 7 or 8. Modifiers to die rolls are allowed, so a roll of 6 with "Strategic Planning" would destroy Scar. If a nuke allows raiders to be destroyed, he can be chosen only if the die roll was a 7 or 8. If a game effect allows you to destroy a raider without a die roll, Scar cannot be chosen. If a game effect includes a roll to see "how many" raiders to destroy, Scar can be chosen only if that roll was a 7 or an 8. Kat's "Hot Shot" ability skips the die roll, and so cannot be used to destroy Scar. 

#### Heavy raiders and Centurions
When heavy raiders are activated, do *all* of the following: 

1. Move all centurions on the board one 1 space further on the Boarding Party track
- If a heavy raider is already in a space area with a launch icon, it is removed from the board and replaced with a Centurion on the start of the Boarding Party track (if there are not enough Centurion tokens, leave the heavy raider in space). 
- Move all heavy raiders on the board toward the closest viper launch icon
- If there were no heavy raiders on the board, launch one from each basestar. 

When something says to "activate heavy raiders", that *always* includes Centurions as well unless otherwise stated. 

Multiple Centurions can occupy the same space at the same time, they do not "push" each other forward. 

If a heavy raider would normally enter a viper launch tube, but there are no Centurion tokens, it stays on the board since it cannot be converted to a Centurion. As always, the current player decides which order to resolve them in. 

#### Basestars

Basestars are destroyed after taking 3 damage tokens. When a basestar is damaged, draw a token. Each token has some sort of effect:

- The "2" is a Critical Hit, which counts for 2 damage tokens instead of just 1. 
- The raider is a Disabled Hanger, which prevents that basestar from launching raiders *or* heavy raiders.
- The 3 missiles firing is Disabled Weapons, which prevents the basestar from firing on Galactica. 
- The image of a basestar is Structural Damage, which gives a +2 bonus to attacks against that basestar. 

If a game effect instructs you to "destroy a basestar", it is simply destroyed without drawing damage tokens. When a basestar with 2 damage tokens is damaged again, that basestar is simply destroyed without drawing another damage token. 

The Ionian Nebula option includes 2 other types of damage:

- The 3 raiders with a burst behind them is Collateral Damage, which destroys up to 3 raiders in the same space area as the damaged basestar when it is drawn.
- The two hexagons with pictures of the Galactica memorial wall is Damage to Personnel, which forces each Cylon player to draw 2 trauma tokens when it is drawn. 

When playing with these tokens, a basestar with 2 damage tokens that is damaged again *should* have another token drawn before destroying it, since these new types of damage have effects outside of the basestar itself. 

### Ship locations

Some ships are much larger than combat ships, and they contain locations that a player may move to to perform a location-based Action. Cylon locations are accessible to revealed Cylon players only, and human locations are accessible to human players only. 

During a move, a player may move to any location on the same ship at no cost. There is no die rolling to move a number of "spaces", the character's token is simply moved to the desired location. When moving between ships, a player must first discard 1 Skill card. A player piloting a combat ship may also do this, see the "Piloting" section for more details. 

Except where noted, each of these locations is human, and Cylon players may not move to them. 

#### Battlestar Galactica

Galactica is the main military ship in the fleet. It is destroyed when it has 6 damage tokens on it. If Galactica is destroyed, the humans lose. 

When Galactica is damaged, draw a damage token and reveal it. If it shows a resource icon, lose 1 of that resource and remove that damage token from the game. If it shows an image of a location, that location is damaged. When a location is damaged, any characters in that location are sent to Sickbay. Leave the token on that location to indicate that it is damaged. Afterward, the damaged location can be moved to, but its action cannot be used until the location is repaired. When it is repaired, the damage token goes back into the damage token pile.

#### Battlestar Pegasus

Pegasus has damage tokens as well, which works just the same as Galactica's. There are no "resource" icons on Pegasus damage tokens, just Pegasus locations. When Galactica is damaged, the current player may choose to damage Pegasus instead. Pegasus is destroyed if all 4 locations on it are damaged. Any characters on board Pegasus when it is destroyed are sent to Sickbay, and the Pegasus board is removed from the game. 

#### Colonial One

If Colonial One is destroyed by a game effect, flip the overlay over to reveal the "Colonial One Destroyed" side. (These effects are only included in Daybreak which includes the overlay.) Any characters on board are sent to Sickbay, and the locations on Colonial One are inaccessible for the rest of the game.

During the New Caprica phase, Colonial One is not accessible. (It is being held captive by the Cylons on New Caprica, and won't escape until after the game ends.)

#### Demetrius

Demetrius is used in the "Search for Home" ending. Its locations cannot be damaged. 

To activate a Mission, place the top card of the Mission deck face up on the "Active Mission" space. It is immediately resolved. Each Mission is a Skill check but there are some special rules:

- Character abilities and card abilities that affect Crisis cards and Skill checks *do not* affect Mission cards and cannot be used. This includes abilities that happen "before" or "after" Skill checks. 
- Any limits on how many cards a player may contribute to a Skill check *do* apply, such as: being in the Brig, being a Cylon, Aaron Doral's "Vanity", etc.
- Skill Check Abilities are *not* resolved during a Mission

Mission cards *always* remain on the Active Mission space until the fleet jumps. They remain face up on the Active Mission space by default. Since new Missions cannot be activated while a card remains, this means that only one Mission can be attempted per jump. 

Any distance from a Mission card applies _immediately_, even though it is only added to the rest of the distance cards after a jump. This could trigger the Sleeper Agent phase or anything else that occurs at a specific distance. The only reason it stays in the Active Mission space is to remind players that they cannot attempt another mission until the next jump.

Follow the instructions on the Active Mission space when jumping to clear the Active Mission. (Essentially, missions without distance are always discarded, missions with distance are shuffled back into the deck if failed or are included as additional distance when passed.)

#### Rebel Basestar (human or Cylon)

The Rebel Basestar is only accessible after it is added to the game by the "Cylon Civil War" Mission card. Depending on the result of this Mission, it is either a Cylon location or a human location. Players of the correct allegiance can travel to it by discarding a Skill card. As always, a Cylon Leader is considered a Cylon unless they are Infiltrating, in which case they are a human player.  

For Raider Bay, the player is only allowed to activate the ships being placed, not any ships that were already present. Apollo may use "Alert Viper Pilot" to commandeer a viper placed using Raider Bay. In this case, Apollo can use the Action granted by "Alert Viper Pilot" in the middle of the Raider Bay Action, and the player using Raider Bay cannot activate Apollo's viper since it is being piloted. 

### Execution

Executions are handled differently based on which Loyalty deck style was used: _extra card_ from Exodus or _original_. Follow one or the other, not both! The _extra card_ procedure only works with the extra loyalty card. Follow this procedure, taking care to only do *one* of the two styles:

1. Discard your entire hand of Skill Cards, any Quorum cards *attached to your character* (these are cards like "Assign Vice President", not the *hand* of Quorum cards), any Mutiny cards, and if playing with Daybreak, any miracle tokens. When not playing with Daybreak, once-per-game status isn't affected by execution since they can't be earned back (you, as a player, get exactly one per game). 
- _Extra card only: If the player executed was the current player, their turn will immediately be over after the execution is resolved._
- Prove your loyalty:
    - Cylons & Cylon Leaders
        - If you were a hidden Cylon player, reveal *one* "You Are a Cylon" card and keep the rest of your Loyalty cards face down. Do not take the action on that card. Follow the rest of the normal procedure for revealing as a Cylon, but do not draw a Super Crisis card. 
        - If you were a Cylon Leader or an exposed Cylon, do the same thing but ignore any instructions about Loyalty cards. As always, Cylon Leaders *do not reveal their agenda or motive!*
    - Human
        1. Reveal *all* your Loyalty cards, showing that none are Cylon cards. For "Final Five" cards, resolve the text for execution.
        - The fleet loses 1 morale. (If this causes Dee to be executed, resolve her execution after this one is finished.)
        - Return your character and token(s) to the box, removing them from the game. Discard any Trauma tokens.
        - _Extra card only: Discard all of your loyalty cards._
        - _Original only: If you are Boomer, and the Sleeper Agent phase hasn't happened yet, draw 1 new Loyalty card._ (_Extra card_ will do this later.)
        - Choose a new character, with no restriction on type. You may not choose an alternate version of an existing character, and you may not choose a Cylon Leader. If there are no more characters left, humans lose. Start in the normal Setup location for that character, or the Hangar Deck if that location is completely unavailable (for example, Colonial One has been destroyed). During the New Caprica phase before Galactica returns, start in Resistance HQ. 
        - _Extra card only: Add 1 "Not a Cylon" card to the Loyalty deck, shuffle, and draw 1 new card. If Boomer was the one executed and the Sleeper Agent phase hasn't been reached yet, now is when they draw 1 new Loyalty card._
        - Distribute any former titles to the first in the respective line of succession, taking into account the new character. Existing titles do not change hands, even if the new character is higher in the line of succession. 
        - If the executed character was the Mutineer, the new character receives the Mutineer card again and follows the instructions for becoming the Mutineer. 
        - If playing with Trauma tokens, draw 3 new Trauma tokens. If a "disaster" token is drawn, set it aside and draw a new one to replace it, then return the "disaster" token to the pool (just like at the start of the game).
        - If one of these characters was chosen, there are some addtional rules and clarifications:
            - Boomer: 
                - If after the Sleeper Agent phase, start in the Brig.
                - _Original only: If before the Sleeper Agent phase, shuffle 1 "Not A Cylon" card into the Loyalty deck._
                - _Extra card only: Shuffle 1 "Not a Cylon" card into the Loyalty deck no matter what phase it is. If it's after Sleeper Agent, draw an additional Loyalty card._
            - Helo: Start out "Stranded" even though it is not the beginning of the game.
            - Apollo: Start in a viper from the reserves. If none are available, start in the Hangar Deck. 
            - Gaius Baltar: 
                - If before the Sleeper Agent phase, shuffle 1 "Not a Cylon" cad into the Loyalty deck and draw 1 Loyalty card. 
                - _Original only: If after the Sleeper Agent phase, Gaius may not use his Cylon Detector ability._
            - Anders: Skip the Receive Skill cards step of your first turn as Anders due to "Starts on the Bench". 
            - Tom Zarek (Military): Draw a Mutiny card due to "Disruptive". 

You cannot use a new character's ability on the effect that executed the previous character. For example, if a Quorum card executes a player who comes back as Tory Foster, she cannot then use her "Adaptable" ability on that Quorum card. A new character can, however, use an ability on things that happen soon after. For example, if the Airlock executes a player who comes back as Adama, the "discard cards" step of the Skill check comes after the "determine result" step which cause the execution. This means that Adama may use his once-per-game "Command" ability to draw those cards into his hand instead. 


### Sleeper Agent phase

At the Sleeper Agent phase, more Loyalty cards are dealt to every player except for Cylon Leaders. It begins when the distance specified on the Objective card is reached. Upon reaching this distance or more, deal 1 Loyalty card to every player who is not a Cylon Leader, including revealed Cylon players. Revealed Cylons must ignore any game text that says to "immediately reveal this card". If the Cylon Leader is using Motive cards, deal 2 more Motive cards to them.

When playing with the "You Are a Mutineer" card, if no one has revealed as the Mutineer after all the Sleeper Agent phase cards have been dealt, the current player chooses a human player to draw an extra Loyalty card from the Loyalty deck. In this case, if they subsequently reveal the Mutineer card, they do not replace it with another Loyalty card. 

#### Revealed Cylons

If the Resurrection Ship is a hazardous location, revealed Cylon players should receive Loyalty cards, look at them, then immediately pass them on to *one* human player of their choice. They should not follow any text that says to "immediately reveal this card". The human player who receives these cards is the one who will reveal them.  

If the Resurrection Ship is not hazardous, revealed Cylons get their extra Loyalty card, but do not automatically pass them off, nor do they reveal them even if it says to "immediately reveal this card". Instead, they can choose to pass them off as an action in the Resurrection Ship when the game resumes.

#### Sharon "Boomer" Valerii

Sharon "Boomer" Valerii normally receives 2 Loyalty cards in the Sleeper Agent phase instead of 1, as per her negative ability. If "Boomer" has already revealed as a Cylon, however, her negative ability should no longer apply because character abilities are ignored as a revealed Cylon. If playing with an extra card style Loyalty deck, this is no problem since there is a mechanism for dealing with this already. Otherwise, deal the extra card to "Boomer" despite technically no longer having that weakness so that there is not an extra Loyalty card left over. 


## Ending the game

### Final jump

For the Kobol, Ionian Nebula, and Earth objectives, after the indicated distance is reached, the next time the fleet jumps will end the game. When this happens, the normal jump procedure is skipped, so there is no "Remove Ships" step and no Destination card is drawn. The "FTL Control" location does still trigger a population loss if the die roll is 6 or lower, since this happens before the the jump. 

For the final jump, Cylon Leaders must wait until all other effects are resolved before they can reveal "game is over" Motive cards or declare their Agenda fulfilled. If the humans survive the jump, resolve game effects that take place at the end of the game such as unfulfilled Personal Goal cards. If the humans have still not lost, the humans win. 

When resolving end of game effects, unrevealed Cylons are still treated as human players but they ultimately win or lose with the Cylons. Cylon Leaders are treated as human or Cylon depending on whether or not they are infiltrating as usual. 

With the New Caprica objective, the final jump ends the game as described above, however this jump can only be initiated by the Admiral as an action after Galactica returns. The Jump Preparation track does not advance, and the FTL Control location cannot be used. 

### New Caprica phase

The humans reach New Caprica and attempt to settle there. However, they are discovered by the Cylons and Galactica and Pegasus are forced to flee. The humans will have to wait out the Cylon occupation while waiting for their battlestars to return. Once they do, the humans will have to evacuate New Caprica and jump away to safety. 

#### New Caprica phase setup


- If this distance was reached via a jump, go through the normal jump procedure including resetting the fleet marker. 
    - Assault raptors do not get to remain in space for this jump, so return them to the reserves with the rest of the ships. 
    - If the destination is "Gas Cloud", the Admiral gets to examine the New Caprica Crisis deck, not the old Crisis deck.
    - The Destination card could put ships back on the main game board after the jump. 
- If it was not reached via a jump (for example earning distance through a Skill check), just reset the fleet marker. 
- Any ships and Centurions still on the board at this point will remain unless instructed otherwise.
- Remove the Crisis deck from the game. The New Caprica Crisis deck will be used from now on. 
- The New Caprica game board goes above the Pegasus game board.
- All human players are moved to "Resistance HQ", including any in the Brig. Manned vipers are returned to the Reserves. 
- All Cylon players are moved to "Occupation Authority"
- Move all remaining raptors to the New Caprica board. They can still be risked even before Galactica returns. 
- Shuffle all remaining civilian ships, whether in space or in the stockpile, into a single stack on the "Locked Civilian Ships" box. 

Until Galactica returns to orbit, as described below, all players may only move to New Caprica locations. Even when it does, Colonial One will not return. (Story wise, it was the last ship to leave New Caprica, and it was under Cylon control until then.) You may choose to use the Colonial One overlay's "destroyed" side to indicate this. 

#### New Caprica phase rules

The New Caprica Crisis deck replaces the regular Crisis deck for the rest of the game. Game effects that target the Crisis deck now target that deck. The "Prepare for Jump" icon is always accompanied by an "evacuation icon" when it appears on New Caprica Crisis cards. "Prepare for Jump" is resolved before Galactica returns, and the evacuation icon is resolved afterward. 

Locations on New Caprica can have "Human" and "Cylon" actions. Only human players may use human actions, and only Cylon players may use Cylon actions, but both types of player may move to New Caprica locations as they would other locations. There are also 2 actions at the top of the board that can be used while on any New Caprica space. (For Laura Roslin's "Terminal Illness", these 2 Actions do not count as activating a location.) Athena's "Resolute" ability can activate either the human or Cylon action on a New Caprica location.

Occupation Forces are a new type of Cylon "ship", which travel along the track at the bottom of the New Caprica board. When they are activated:

- An Occupation Force on the Shipyard leaves the board. As it leaves, it destroys a Locked civilian ship if any exist, otherwise it destroys a Prepared civilian ship, and does nothing else if both stacks are empty. 
- Occupation Forces not at the Shipyard move one space to the right along the track.
- If there were no Occupation Forces on the track when they were activated, place one at the start under Occupation Authority. 

Centurions do not advance when Occupation Forces are activated and vice versa, they are completely separate from one another although they look similar. 

To "prepare" a civilian ship, move the civilian ship on the *top* of the Locked Civilian Ships stack to the *bottom* of the Prepared Civilian Ships stack. 

Civilian ships may *only* be moved out of the Locked or Prepared Civilian Ship stacks via game effects that specifically refer to those places. When another game effect requires drawing or placing civilian ships, they must be drawn from the regular pile by the board as usual. Unless ships have been escorted off the board, this probably means that there won't be any, and normal component limitation rules will apply. 

When re-rolling an "Attack Occupation Force" roll using "Maximum Firepower" that also had "Maximum Firepower" applied to it, the re-roll also gets the "Maximum Firepower" bonus. 

As stated on the alternate President card, when the President plays a Quorum card, they must roll a die, and if 3 or lower move to Detention. This only occurs when playing a Quorum card *from the hand*, not, for example, using Roslin's "Skilled Politician" once-per-game.

##### Brig versus Detention

When a character is on a New Caprica location:

- Any effect that sends them to the Brig instead sends them to Detention
- Any character ability that applies to the Brig instead applies to Detention
- If the President is on New Caprica, Quorum cards that apply to the Brig instead apply to Detention

Just like the Brig, a Cylon who reveals in Detention does not get to use the ability on their Loyalty card. Similar to the Brig, when the board says that a player who passes the Skill check may move to "any location", it actually means any location _on New Caprica_.

Unlike the Brig, the Admiral does not lose their title when sent to Detention. Players still draw a Crisis card in Detention. 

If Romo Lampkin is on New Caprica and uses "Attorney", he instead moves a character from Detention to a location on New Caprica and steals their Skill cards. 

##### Before Galactica returns

The Galactica space areas, Cylon Fleet board, and any Cylon ships or Centurions in them are not affected by any game mechanics. Ignore any Cylon ship activations on Crisis cards (with the exception of "Occupation Forces" activations) and ignore anything that says to place, move, destroy, repair, or damage any ships including vipers, Galactica, and Pegasus. Civilian ships cannot be placed in space areas. 

**Raptors may still be risked before Galactica returns.**

Game effects that would normally send a player to the Resurrection Ship instead send them to the Medical Center. This includes execution, revealing as a Cylon, or ending Infiltration. Cylon Leaders cannot begin infiltrating because they would need to move to the Human Fleet location first. 

If Felix Gaeta uses his "Coup" Action while in Detention before Galactica returns, he moves to Resistance HQ instead of Command. Doral's "Meticulous" ability instead allows him to move to any New Caprica location and take another action instead of moving to the Medical Center. 

Only locations on New Caprica may be activated. Athena's "Resolute" ability and Hoshi's "Organized" ability cannot access any unavailable locations. The "Evacuation" icon on Crisis cards does not have any effect until Galactica returns, but the "Prepare for Jump" icon is still used to move the Jump Preparation track. 

Resolve New Caprica Crisis cards as normal, ignoring the "evacuation icon" for now. The fleet marker advances as usual. When it reaches "Auto Jump", Galactica returns and the final battle is set up. 

##### After Galactica returns

When Galactica returns, first place 1 basestar and 4 raiders in each of the 2 top space areas. Place 2 vipers in each of the 2 bottom space areas (4 total). 

Do not use the jump track anymore, and ignore the "Prepare to Jump" icon. Instead, to resolve the "Evacuation" icon, the current player takes a civilian ship from the top of the Prepared Civilian Ships space and moves it to any space area with a viper launch icon. If no ships are in the Prepared pile, nothing happens. Since the final jump is at the sole discretion of the Admiral, do not use the jump track. 

Human players may now move between New Caprica, Galactica, and the other human ships by discarding a Skill card. However, Colonial One is not accessible during the New Caprica phase, even after Galactica comes back. Cylon players may also move between New Caprica and the other Cylon locations by discarding a Skill card. Ships and Centurions are once again affected by game effects as normal. 

When playing with the Cylon Fleet option, vipers may use their "escort civilian ships" activation on civilian ships in their space area. 

##### Ending the game

Once Galactica is in orbit, the Admiral has an action available on their title card which initiates the final jump and ends the game. 

Destroy all civilian ships still on New Caprica. Execute all human players on New Caprica. After these steps are fully resolved, resolve any other effects that are stated to occur at the end of the game. The humans win if they have not lost at this point, and the Cylon Leader determines if they have won or lost as well. 



### Ionian Nebula

#### Crossroads Phase

The Crossroads phase begins immediately upon reaching 8 or more distance, interrupting the current player's turn. Each character faces an important decision. There are 3 steps to the Crossroads phase:

##### Set up the Battle of the Ionian Nebula

The Cylons are lying in wait to attack Galactica. Place a basestar and 4 raiders in each of the top 2 main board space areas. Launch 2 vipers into each of the two bottom space areas. Finally, reset the jump track. (This reset takes the place of the "reset jump track" step of the jump that has been interrupted. The jump track is not reset again after the Crossroads phase ends.)

##### Draw and resolve Crossroads cards

The current player shuffles the Crossroads deck and deals each player 1 card. Each player secretly looks at theirs, and selects 1 Trauma token to play facedown next to their Crossroads card. The indicated icon is the result that will be resolved. A player with no Trauma tokens may simply select either result when the card is revealed. 

Once all players have made their selection, the current player reveals their card and token. The chosen result is resolved, and the next player reveals their choice. Resolve any executions normally when they occur, but the executed player's Crossroads card and token choice remain. 

##### The Trial/Boxing the Line

1. Remove all Crossroads cards and the Trauma tokens used with them from the game. Also remove all Ally cards and tokens, the Trauma tokens attached to them, and the Trauma tokens on board locations from the game. 
- Each player reveals all of their Trauma tokens. Human players discard their "Benevolent" tokens, while Cylon players discard all of their "Antagonistic" tokens.
- Each player with 2 or fewer tokens at this point discards them. 
- Each player counts the number of tokens they have remaining.
- If all players have 0 tokens, then no player is eliminated. If not, the player with the most tokens is eliminated from the game. 
    - If human players are tied, the President chooses one of the tied players for elimination.
    - If Cylon players are tied, each tied Cylon player is eliminated.
    - If both human and Cylon players are tied, follow *both* rules. All tied Cylons are eliminated, and the President chooses which tied human is eliminated. 

#### Elimination

To eliminate a player from the game, follow the rules for execution, but do not choose a new character, and do not move to the Resurrection Ship. The eliminated player is entirely removed from the rest of the game. If they were the current player, the next player is now the current player. 

#### Finishing the game

After the Crossroads phase, the next jump ends the game. No Destination card is drawn for this final jump. 

## House rules

### Official variants

These come from the "optional rules" for the base game. The expansions don't always address these variants when they change the rules, so you might have to use your own judgement. 

#### No Sympathizer

Most of the expansions also come with their own ways to avoid the  "Sympathizer" card, since it proved to be rather unpopular. These rules only apply in a 4 or 6 player game without a Cylon Leader and without Daybreak (since Daybreak mandates a Mutineer.)

To play with this variant: 

- Sharon "Boomer" Valerii is not allowed in a 6 player game. 
- Follow the instructions for building the Loyalty deck as normal, but add a "Not a Cylon" card when the instructions say to add the "Sympathizer" card. 
- Start the game with 8 fuel, 7 food, 9 morale, and 10 population. 
- During the game, a revealed Cylon may draw 3 cards instead of 2. 

#### Two player game

Both players choose any character they want, except "Boomer". Do not create a Loyalty deck during setup. Instead, during the Sleeper Agent phase, create a Loyalty deck of:

- 1 "You Are a Cylon" card
- 2 "Not a Cylon" cards
- 1 more "Not a Cylon" card for each resource that is in the red

Shuffle and deal 1 card to each player. 

#### One player game

To set up, choose a character that is not "Boomer" and not Laura Roslin. This is your main character. Then choose another character as an "assist character". Build a Loyalty deck of 1 "You Are a Cylon", 6 "Not a Cylon" cards and deal 3 to the assist character. As the main character, you receive all the title cards. Start with 1 nuke instead of 2. 

Ignore all negative character abilities in this variant. 

The assist character does not get placed on the board, draw cards, take actions, or hold any titles. While playing the game, you may treat the assist character's once-per-game ability as if it were on your own character sheet. When receiving Skill cards, 1 is allowed to come from the assist character's Skill set (with a maximum of 5 total Skill cards). 

At the end of the "Activate Cylon Ships" step, if heavy raiders were activated during that step, reveal 1 of the assist character's Loyalty cards. If it is a Cylon card, resolve it and remove the assist character from the game. You can no longer use their Skill set or once-per-game ability. The "Can Damage Galactica" Loyalty card is instead resolved as "draw and resolve 2 Galactica damage tokens". The character that is targeted is always the main character. 

After you look at the assist character's Loyalty card or cards, or if the assist character receives new Loyalty cards, shuffle them. 

While in the Brig, movement is restricted as normal, but you still draw a Crisis card, and you may play up to 3 cards into a Skill check. 

At the Sleeper Agent phase, add a "Not a Cylon" card to the Loyalty deck for each resource in the red. Then deal 4 Loyalty cards to the assist character and shuffle their cards. 


#### Fully cooperative game

In this variant, there are no hidden Cylons. Do not build a Loyalty deck. The Admiral starts with just 1 nuke. Remove "Encourage Mutiny", "Release Cylon Mugshots", "Assign Arbitrator", and "Arrest Order" from the Quorum deck. Start with 8 fuel, 7 food, 9 morale, and 10 population. 

Each character must draw 1 less Skill card during the "Receive Skills" step. They may choose which card is not drawn.

Characters in the Brig still draw Crisis cards. 

### Loyalty deck styles

When building the Loyalty deck, a decision has to be made about which expansion's rules to follow. The Exodus expansion rules change the Loyalty deck's construction and the way executions work:

- In Exodus, not all the Loyalty cards are dealt. That means that a "You Are A Cylon" card might never enter the game. However, when a human is executed, they have a chance of drawing that last card, so executions are riskier. In essence, there is more intrigue, but a chance that the game will end with 1 Cylon never appearing. This rulebook refers to this as the "extra card style" Loyalty deck. 
- In contrast, under the Pegasus execution rules, an executed human comes back after revealing all their Loyalty cards and doesn't get a new one. That makes them a guaranteed human for the cost of morale and having to pick a new character. This approach is simpler, and will not leave out any Cylon cards, but it allows a relatively cheap "human test" that, thematically, doesn't make much sense. This rulebook refers to this as the "original style" Loyalty deck, since it does not modify the version from the base game. 

By the official rules, as one might expect, the Exodus rules are to be followed only when including the Exodus expansion. This makes some sense, especially when also adding in "Final Five" or "Personal Goal" cards, since each execution could also result in a human player being hampered with one of these cards. If you really hate the idea of executions being a viable test of humanity, there's no reason you couldn't play by Exodus rules regardless. Conversely, if you really hate the idea of a Cylon potentially never appearing, you can play by Pegasus as long as there are no Personal Goal cards. 

The execution rules in this ruleset are written based on whichever style you chose, not which expansions are in use, so you can choose to your heart's content. You could also use a house rule. Some examples include:

- Extra card rules, then at distance 7, all human players roll the die. The lowest receives the final Loyalty card, guaranteeing that the last Cylon gets out at some point.
- Original rules, but a new human character must draw from a special deck that is half "Personal Goal"/"Final Five" cards, half normal "Not A Cylon" cards. They'll still be a guaranteed human, but dealing with the special Loyalty card can penalize the humans for killing an innocent. 
- Extra card rules, then at the end of the game, if the remaining card was a Cylon, deduct 1 from each resource as a handicap before declaring a human victory. 



### Cylon Leaders

To add Cylon Leaders to any game, you really only *need* three things from either Pegasus or Daybreak. You can also do some customization, for example playing with Motive cards. 

- Treachery cards. If you want to be as minimal as possible, you might be able to just add the Pegasus Skill cards and nothing else. That might not be very balanced, though. Daybreak's Treachery is very much tied in with the rest of the expansion. 
- A "Cylon Locations" overlay. Both are basically the same, and are only *really* needed for the "Infiltrate Galactica" action. You could also just assume that "infiltrating" is an Action that Cylon Leaders can take by moving to the Human Fleet space. 
- One of the two Cylon Leader alignment mechanics. You can basically pick which one independently:
    - Pegasus includes Agenda cards, which can be included as-is. The Leader gets one from either the "Hostile" or "Sympathetic" deck, depending on the total number of players (odd is hostile, even is sympathetic). 
    - Daybreak includes Motive cards. These are a little more interesting, the Leader gets 2 to start and 2 more at the Sleeper Agent phase, so their alignment can shift over the game. The only wrinkle is that *one* of them refers to Mutiny cards. If you take that one out, along with another of the opposite alignment, then it's usable without the rest of Daybreak. 


### Alllies for All Seasons

Designed by Alexander DeSouza, these rules allow you to incorporate Ally cards and tokens without using the Ionian Nebula endgame. 

To setup for Allies for All Seasons, just before starting the game:

- Remove all "disaster" tokens from the game. Set up the Trauma tokens as normal, but do not add tokens to the Brig or Sickbay. 
- Set up 3 allies as described in the standard rules (no duplicates of existing characters, place the token in the indicated location) but do not place a Trauma token on the Ally. 
- Each player draws 4 Trauma tokens, and contribues 1 to create the Mood Pool. 

Generally, the rules for Allies are the same as in the base game, including the fact that they cannot coexist with a duplicate of the same character in one game. The difference is the way that Trauma tokens are drawn for them, which uses the Mood Pool instead of a token on their card. 

#### Trauma tokens

Players must draw a Trauma token when they are sent to the Brig or Sickbay. In addition, a hidden Cylon who is executed must draw a Trauma token upon entering the Resurrection Ship. Unlike in Ionian Nebula, players only take a token when sent to that location, not for starting a turn in that location. 

#### Mood Pool

Allies do not have their own Trauma token, instead the Mood Pool is used, which represents the overall mood of the ship. Humans want the mood to be Benevolent, but must also keep their own stock of tokens Benevolent, and the reverse is true for Cylons. 

The Mood Pool should always have the same number of tokens as there are players, except in the middle of an Ally encounter. When instructed to draw or discard tokens in any other way, players should always use the regular pool, not the Mood Pool. 

#### Encountering an Ally

When an Ally is encountered, draw and reveal a token from the Mood Pool. Resolve this result with the Ally, and remove the Ally from the game. The player who encountered the Ally takes the drawn token, adds it to their set of tokens, randomizes, and then contributes any 1 of their tokens back to the Mood Pool. 

#### Allies damaged or chosen after an execution

Follow the regular rules for handling allies who get damaged or replaced by a player, except when the original rules would allow a Cylon to place one of their Trauma tokens on an Ally, they instead get to look at the entire Mood Pool and exchange one token in the Mood Pool with one of their own. 

#### Distance 8

At distance 8, all players reveal their Trauma tokens. Human players count Benevolent tokens as positive and Antagonistic tokens as negative. Cylon players count Antagonistic as positive and Benevolent as negative. Each is weighted equally at either +1 or -1. 

Players total their net score and each does the following:

|  Net score  | Result                               |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| -3 or lower | The player is executed.              |
|     -2      | Discard 4 Skill cards.               |
|     -1      | Discard 2 Skill cards.               |
|      0      | Nothing happens.                     |
|     +1      | Draw 2 Skill cards of any type.      |
|     +2      | Draw 4 Skill cards of any type.      |
| +3 or more  | Add or subtract 1 from any resource. |
