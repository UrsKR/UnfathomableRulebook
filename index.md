# BSG - The unified rulebook

This rulebook is intended to be a single source for looking up rules for Battlestar Galactica, unifying the various sources of information in a single place. It's also intended to be as detailed and precise as possible.

[Click here to check out the rulebook itself!](rulebook.html)

Please [submit corrections or suggestions to me](https://github.com/jbiatek/BSGRulebook/issues) if something is wrong or unclear. Right now, the biggest thing missing is probably images, since this grew out of a plain text file and is only now moving onto the web.
